This is a template for my projects for embedded targets.
It is made for LPC1769 probably it will also work on LPC1768, other LPC17xx not tested.

Please refer to INSTALL file for tool requirements.
COPYING file contains licence agreement (GNU GPL v3).

The project follows the rules [Semantic Versioning](ghttp://semver.org/) 
and uses [Doxygen](www.doxygen.org) for documentation.


We defined project structure as follow:
root/makefile - makefile
root/LPC1769.ld - linker script
root/doxyfile - doxygen configuration file
root/ChangeLog.md - change log
root/COPYING - copying rights
root/INSTALL.md - install information
root/README.md - this file
root/THANKS - special thanks for support
root/TODO.md - list of things to be done, in progress and TODOs which are already closed
root/release - files which are generated by compiler, doxygen and other tools which are treated as outputs
root/src - source files
root/src/lib - library files like for e.g. CMSIS. Other example here i lamp class which
               should be treated as a library because here you define behaviour and internal operations,
               and the actual usage is in application. The same can be with other more sophisticated
               libraries like USB stack, TCPIP stack and so on.
root/src/app - application files like main.cpp. Also other files may be created here like
               for e.g. application layer for USB or other features. In this folder you can
               also create subfolders if for e.g. application layer for feature contains more than 1 file.
