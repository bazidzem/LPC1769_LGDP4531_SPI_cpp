List of open items:

* Linker script to be done when HW will be available
* template files for c, cpp and h (remember about doxygen)
* add class LED as a part of the template to get feeling how to add new api modules in C++. 
   This class shall be placed in h and cpp files which shall be treated as a template files(see point 2)
   c file doesn't need separate example of template(I think it should be the same like cpp) 
* dependences not created during compilation
* listings not created during compilation
* logs not created during compilation
* generated *flags.sub put in folder release/sub 
* sym file recognize
* add some linker options so it generates more warnings (unknown sections etc.)
